The purpose of OUMF - Saturn Shmup Demo is for me to learn the Jo Engine's capabilities by modifying its included shooter example game. 
I plan on making the game more accessible and have a more intuitive game loop. 
I want to get comfortable with Jo engine in order use it during game jams and beyond.
Putting my efforts on github is to benefit myself and anyone interested in Saturn development.
